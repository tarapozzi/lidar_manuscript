Hi Vicken, 

Introduction & theory section are still a work in progress so you can skip that part for now. I will have a draft of that for you next week!

High-level questions: 

1. I chose to narrow in on Washington and Idaho because I was able to find comparable data on flood risk in each state. See table 1 in the report. Unfortunately, I could not find this information on Oregon. Is that okay to just focus on the two states? Or do you feel like we are missing out?
2. Thoughts on overall structure of manuscript?

Methods: 
1. Survey analysis section: is it helpful to include these equations? should I include the bayesian probability equation?
2. Anything else I should include here on methods? Maybe the case study section would be more fit for the methods section in the report? Right now, I have it in theory because it talks about how I am applying the theory to our project. Also, the case study is ready to be reviewed as well if you have time.

Results: 
1. Table 3: I probably need to report 95% CI instead of the 10/90 values? Are there other values I should report on here?
2. This section is basically broken down into three parts: predictors with significant effect, moderate effect, no effect. Does this seem like a good approach for discussing the results?
3. Also might add a section in about barriers and include that bargraph that I made for the webinar. Do you think this would be a good addition?

Additional comment-- I wrote a lot of notes/questions in (parentheses) that I need some direction on. 

Thanks so much!
