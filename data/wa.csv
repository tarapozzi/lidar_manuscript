The purpose of this survey is to better understand how managers make decisions about flood risk management. You have been identified as a potential knowledgeable member of the industry who could provide information for our study. This survey will ask about you, the community you work in, and your use of lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) in flood risk management. Your response will contribute to our understanding of the role lidar plays in flood risk management, and help us identify barriers that may exist in its implementation. 

 

This survey should take less than 15 minutes to complete.

 

By selecting “I want to participate”, you are providing your consent to take part in this study. 


This survey is completely anonymous. No personally identifiable information will be associated with your responses in any reports resulting from this survey. Your participation is voluntary. If there are any items that you would prefer to skip, please leave the answer blank. You must be at least 18 years old to participate.
